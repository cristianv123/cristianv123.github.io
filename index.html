One of the hardest things anybody can do is to allow themselves to be <b>genuinely seen for who they are</b>. Often are we shadows of our real selves to the people we meet- wishing intently to show the sides of us that are <b>not truly us </b> for fear of admitting that we are so much less than the so carefully crafted character of goodness that we attempt to portray. <p></p> Through being vulnerable and through taking risks on ourselves and on those around us, we are able to experience a <b>much more fulfilling life</b>- one that is free of many of our self imposed shackles that impede our growth.

<dt><i>You will make peace with your past</i></dt>
	<dd>Being vulnerable with yourself gives you the space that you need to be able to come to terms with events that have transpired in your life. It can feel daunting and overwhelming dealing with the traumas that afflict us, but only through being honest with ourselves are we able to able give ourselves a chance to move forward and heal.  
	</dd>
<dt><i>You will strengthen the bonds you share with others</i></dt>
	<dd>Every time we present ourselves fictitiously, we create distance between our real self and the façade we present to others which creates a well of dissonance. By being vulnerable and honest with those around us, we are not only able to foster more intimate relationships where we do not feel disingenuous, but we also begin to heal the relationships that we may once have faltered in. 
	</dd>
<dt><i>You will find it easier to empathize</i></dt>
	<dd>Vulnerability requires immense introspection to understand oneself and our complex identities. This introspection allows one to understand that while many of our hardships might be specific to our own life, it is a truth that everybody struggles with something. Being able to recognize that others might be struggling as much as we are and showing them grace because of it encompasses the compassion pivotal to growing as an individual. 
	</dd>
<dt><i>You will find holding yourself accountable comes easier</i></dt>
	<dd>Allowing yourself to be vulnerable demonstrates a willingness to accept responsibility for your own thoughts, behaviors, and feelings. By being honest with yourself and understanding who you are, where your values lie, what boundaries you require in your life, and what you know you are capable of, it becomes easier to take control of your life and know where your responsibilities lie both to yourself and to others.
